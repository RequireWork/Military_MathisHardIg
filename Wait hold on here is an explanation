This is a place to record whether or not I did study math today. 
I will be writing dates down in a list format when I did study math that day. 
Before I get an actual idea on how to post khan academy progresses here.

07.14: Linear Algebra -> Lesson 1: Vectors (V)
07.15: AP Calculus BC(Trying to review new and old stuff so I can catch up faster on Linear Algebra)
